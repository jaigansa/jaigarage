## Introduction

Choosing and installing an operating system is a fundamental step in setting up any computer. Linux, a powerful and open-source operating system, offers unparalleled flexibility, security, and a vast ecosystem of software. This guide will walk you through the process of installing a Linux-based operating system, covering how to select a distribution, create bootable installation media, and perform the initial setup.

## Main Content

### Choosing Your Linux Distribution and Desktop Environment

One of the first decisions when installing Linux is choosing a distribution (distro) and a desktop environment. The distro is the operating system itself (e.g., Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian), while the desktop environment provides the graphical user interface (e.g., GNOME, KDE Plasma, XFCE).

#### Our Recommendation: Kubuntu LTS

For this guide, we will focus on **Kubuntu LTS**.
*   **Kubuntu:** An official flavor of Ubuntu that uses the KDE Plasma Desktop.
*   **LTS (Long Term Support):** Ensures stability and security updates for several years, making it ideal for users who prefer a reliable and consistent experience.
*   **KDE Plasma:** A modern, customizable, and feature-rich desktop environment known for its aesthetics and powerful tools.

1.  **Download the latest release of Kubuntu LTS:**

### Creating Bootable USB Installation Media



Before installing, you need to create a bootable USB drive with the Kubuntu ISO image. This USB drive will be used to start your computer and begin the installation process.



**Important:** Creating a bootable USB drive will erase all data on the USB stick. Please back up any important files from your USB drive before proceeding.



#### Method 1: Using Etcher



Etcher is a free and open-source utility for flashing OS images to SD cards & USB drives, safely and easily.



1.  **Download Etcher:**

2.  **Install and Launch Etcher:** Follow the installation instructions for your operating system and then launch the application.



3.  **Flash the ISO to USB:**

    *   Click "Flash from file" and select the Kubuntu ISO image you downloaded.

    *   Click "Select target" and choose your USB drive (double-check that you select the correct drive!).

    *   Click "Flash!" to start the process. Etcher will validate the flash, which may take some time.



#### Method 2: Using Ventoy



Ventoy is an open-source tool to create a bootable USB drive for ISO/WIM/IMG/VHD(x)/EFI files. With Ventoy, you don't need to format the disk repeatedly; you just need to copy the ISO file to the USB drive and boot it.



1.  **Download Ventoy:**

2.  **Install Ventoy to USB:** Follow the instructions on the Ventoy website to install Ventoy onto your USB drive. This is a one-time process.



3.  **Copy ISO to Ventoy USB:** Once Ventoy is installed on your USB drive, simply copy the Kubuntu ISO file directly to the Ventoy USB drive. You can copy multiple ISOs if you wish.

### Booting from the USB Drive and Installation

Once your bootable USB drive is ready, you need to configure your computer to boot from it.

1.  **Access BIOS/UEFI or Boot Menu:**
    *   Restart your computer.
    *   Immediately and repeatedly press the key to enter your BIOS/UEFI settings or the boot menu. Common keys include `F2`, `F10`, `F12`, `Del`, or `Esc`. The exact key varies by manufacturer (e.g., Asus uses `ESC` or `F2` for BIOS, `F8` for boot menu).
    *   If you enter BIOS/UEFI, navigate to the "Boot" section and set your USB drive as the primary boot device. Save and exit.
    *   If you enter the boot menu, simply select your USB drive from the list.

2.  **Start the Installation:**
    *   Your computer should now boot from the USB drive. You will typically see an option to "Try Kubuntu" or "Install Kubuntu." It's often recommended to "Try Kubuntu" first to ensure hardware compatibility.
    *   If using Ventoy, you will see a menu of ISO files; select your Kubuntu ISO.

3.  **Follow the On-Screen Installer:**
    The Kubuntu installer is user-friendly and will guide you through the remaining steps:
    *   **Language Selection:** Choose your preferred language.
    *   **Keyboard Layout:** Select your keyboard layout.
    *   **Network Connection:** Connect to Wi-Fi or an Ethernet network.
    *   **Installation Type:** You can choose to install alongside an existing OS, erase the entire disk, or manually partition. **Caution:** Be very careful with partitioning to avoid data loss.
    *   **User Setup:** Create your username, password, and computer name.
    *   **Time Zone:** Select your time zone.

4.  **Restart and Enjoy:**
    Once the installation is complete, remove the USB drive when prompted and restart your computer. Your new Kubuntu system should boot up.
